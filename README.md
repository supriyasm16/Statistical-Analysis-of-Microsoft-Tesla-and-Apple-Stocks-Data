# Statistical-Analysis-of-Microsoft-Tesla-and-Apple-Stocks-Data

The project aims to present a comparative analysis of stock market data from 2018 to 2023, focusing on prominent technology giants such as Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple. 
The dataset includes real-time stock information gathered from the Yahoo Finance website, providing daily stock values for these companies throughout the specified timeframe. 
Additionally, the dataset incorporates S&P 500 values, which serve as a stock market index monitoring the performance of 500 major companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges.
Within the dataset, there is a variable labeled "%change," representing the percentage change in stock values for each company. 
The analysis utilizes advanced Excel techniques, including regression, pivot tables, and data analysis, to generate various visualizations that highlight key trends in the stock market data.
